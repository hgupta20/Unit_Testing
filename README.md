# Unit_Testing
Unit Testing of Grade Analysis classes &amp; functions, 

As you know, testing is hard. The idea of unit testing is to approach the problem of testing in a more
rigorous fashion. 

The idea is to design software with testing in mind, and then spend the time and effort
necessary to develop rigorous tests to run against that software. Developing a suite of test cases can take as
much time as it takes to develop the software itself. The benefit of this effort is (a) more confidence in the
software being built, and (b) the ability to rerun these test cases as the software evolves.

These are the test cases for GradeUtil API
